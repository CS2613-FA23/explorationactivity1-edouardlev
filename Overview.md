# Overview of Selenium WebDriver
## By Edouard Levesque

### Selenium WebDriver
### The purpose
Selenium is an open source automated testing framework that can be used to do a plethora of testing. It works in C#, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, Python and PHP. [ref](https://www.alphabold.com/selecting-a-programming-language-for-selenium-webdriver/)

 Selenium is a suite of software, each piece being able to do different testing for different needs of whoever uses it. Precisely, WebDriver is a library component of the Selenium suite used for browser automation.  Browser automation is testing software in a web browser with automated solutions. WebDriver can fill out forms, navigate through websites and extract data. The library's functions are simulating user interaction. This is important for testing and building higher quality software. Manual (human) testing simply does not cut it anymore as there are many browsers that require tests. Using a testing library like WebDriver allows us to redo the tests on multiple browsers and reduce the risk of human errors. [ref](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/what-is-browser-automation)
Selenium also works on a variety of browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge, Opera and more.

### How to use it 
As mentioned in the readme file, you must install it first by running the command: 
```console
 pip3 install selenium
```
Then, in order to interact with a web browser, you must download a web driver. If you're using Safari, you do not need to install anything. For the purpose of this document, let's say you would like to use it with Chrome. You should then install the webdriver from the chromium.org website.

```console
from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Chrome('/Users/MyUsername/Downloads/chromedriver')
```
Like above, we should start by importing WebDriver. The driver should be defined in your program with your driver's path. This represents the browser window we will be manipulating. 

The browser is then ready to start receiving requests through its driver. 

```python
driver.get(https://www.browserstack.com)
```
After this line runs, Chrome will launch to the specified website. Now we can get specific elements within the webpage in order to get information. We're also able to fill out forms, click buttons, refresh the page, use the back and next buttons. We can close the browser aswell.

By creating a program to test your website or web app with WebDriver, you can then store the scraped data from your website and manipulate it as you would any data. Know that WebDriver does not give test results, so it will not tell you if your test file failed or not. It is up to you to determine wether the test worked or not by seeing if the data you wanted was successfully retrieved.

### Various Functionalities

#### Extracting
The main feature of WebDriver (as mentioned above) is getting information from specific web elements. You can do this by locating an element by name, class name, id name, or XPath. HTML knowledge comes in handy here. You can do so by right clicking on an element in your browser>inspect and copying the highlighted element's XPath. The XPath is usually the more foolproof way of getting the element you want.

```python
crypto = browser.find_elements(By.XPATH, '//td[@class="Va(m) Ta(start) Px(10px) Fz(s)"]')
```

In the line above we're getting the list of crypto names after getting the XPath of the specific column of names from the website and assigning it to the crypto variable.

#### filling forms: 
send_Keys() enters values into a text box
```python
import selenium.webdriver.common.keys
...
input_element = driver.find_element_by_name("username")
input_element.send_keys("example_username")
input_element.send_keys(Keys.ENTER)
```
Before using any keys feature, we must have the import at the top. Here we locate the text box "username" on the page and enter "example_username" into it, we then simulate hitting the enter key. We can also use .clear() on input_element to remove whatever text has been added into it. [ref](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/send_keys-element-method-selenium-python/)

#### Clicking: 
to simulate a button click on our opened website, we can use the .click feature.

```python
element_with_xpath = driver.find_element_by_xpath("//button[@id='example-button']")
element_with_xpath.click()
```

#### screenshot:

WebDriver is capable of taking a screenshot of the open webpage

for example: 

```python
TakesScreenshot scrShot =((TakesScreenshot)webdriver);
File SrcFile=scrShot.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
```

The first line converts the web driver object to take a screenshot and the second one instructs it to create a file for it.

#### Go forwards and backwards
Using the webpage forwards and backwards feature is pretty straightforward. You just have to write driver.back() or driver.forward() at whatever point in your program you need to.


### When was it created?

WebDriver was created in 2006 by Simon Stewart. [ref](https://www.webomates.com/blog/software-testing/selenium-testing/)


### Why I selected this library

I selected this library because I found after some quick research that it had a rich set of features that I thought would be interesting to explore. I originally wanted to make a project that would crawl Linkedin pages to get info about job candidates but I found out that most websites don't allow scraping. Beautiful Soup, another well known website scraping library does not work on as many websites as Selenium's WebDriver so that is why I settled on this one.

### How did learning the library influence my learning of the language?

I believe it made me more confident in going to explore new features by myself. I think it affected my learning slightly, it was good practice but in general Python is not a language that is difficult to wrap your head around. I just used what I already knew for the most part.

### How was my overall experience?

I would in fact recommend this library to anybody that needs to interact with their own website for testing. For future reference, if I do need to test my own web projects I would totally keep using this. I feel that it is easy to learn, understand and use.
